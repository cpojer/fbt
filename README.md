**fbtee** (Far Better Translations, Extended Edition) is an internationalization framework for JavaScript designed to be **powerful**, **flexible**, and **intuitive**.

It helps with the following:

-

* Organizing your source text for translation
* Composing grammatically correct translatable User Interfaces
* Eliminating verbose boilerplate for generating User Interfaces

## Status: Ready for Early Adopters

This is a fork of Facebook's original fbt library, which has been archived. The aim of this fork is to create the best and most modern internationalization library for JavaScript & React.
